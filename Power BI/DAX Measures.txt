DAX Measures Used in the Project

1. Total Sales

Code snippet :-

Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Sales])
This measure calculates the sum of all values in the Sales column from the Orders table to get the total revenue.

2. Total Profit

Code snippet :-

Total Profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])
This measure calculates the sum of all values in the Profit column from the Orders table to determine the overall profit.

3. Profit Margin

Code snippet :-

Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])
This calculates the profit margin by dividing the Total Profit by the Total Sales. Using DIVIDE is a safe way to handle potential division-by-zero errors.

4. Total Orders

Code snippet :-

Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID])
This counts the number of unique orders placed by counting the distinct values in the Order ID column.

5. Avg. Discount :-

Code snippet

Avg. Discount = AVERAGE(Orders[Discount])
This measure calculates the average discount applied across all orders by averaging the Discount column.

6. Total Customers

Code snippet :-

Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[Customer ID])
This counts the total number of unique customers by counting the distinct values in the Customer ID column.

7. Total Products :-

Code snippet

Total Products = DISTINCTCOUNT(Products[Product ID])
This counts the total number of unique products available by counting the distinct values in the Product ID column.

8. Target Analysis DAX Measures
Total Target

Code snippet :-

Total Target = SUM(Targets[Target])
This measure calculates the overall sales target by summing all the values in the Target column from the Targets table.

9. Target Achieved %

Code snippet :-

Target Achieved % = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Target])
This measure calculates the percentage of the sales target that has been met by dividing the Total Sales by the Total Target.

10. Performance

Code snippet :-

Performance = 
VAR Achievement = [Target Achieved %]
RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        Achievement >= 1, "Excellent",
        Achievement >= 0.95, "Good",
        Achievement >= 0.85, "Fair",
        "Needs Improvement"
    )
This measure uses a SWITCH function to assign a performance category based on the Target Achieved %. It returns a text label like "Excellent" or "Good" depending on how much of the target was met, which is useful for KPI indicators.
